            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                BLT University is a revolutionary open-source educational platform dedicated to making 
                cybersecurity education accessible to everyone. We believe that security knowledge should 
                be free, collaborative, and community-driven.
            </p>
            <p>
                By leveraging GitHub's powerful collaboration features, we've created a unique learning 
                environment where students learn through doing, instructors teach through pull requests, 
                and the entire community contributes to the growth of knowledge.

                    <h3>📚 GitHub-Powered Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        All courses are hosted on GitHub Pages, making them version-controlled, 
                        transparent, and easily accessible. Students can view course history, 
                        contribute improvements, and track their progress through GitHub.

                    <p>
                        Instructors create and update courses through pull requests. The community 
                        can review, suggest improvements, and help maintain course quality. Teaching 
                        becomes a collaborative effort.

                        GitHub Actions automate enrollment, certificate generation, and course 
                        management. Students interact with courses through issues and pull requests, 
                        learning real-world development practices.
